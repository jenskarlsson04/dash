To clone your Raspberry Pi SD card image, you can create an exact copy of the card and save it as an image file (`.img`) on your computer, or directly duplicate it to another SD card. Here's how to do it, depending on what system you're using:

---

## 🖥️ **If you're on Linux or macOS:**

### 🔁 **Step 1: Insert SD card**
Insert the Raspberry Pi SD card into your computer.

### 🔍 **Step 2: Identify the device**
Run this command to list disk devices:
```bash
lsblk
```
or on macOS:
```bash
diskutil list
```
Find the device name of your SD card, e.g., `/dev/sdb` (Linux) or `/dev/disk2` (macOS).

### ⛔️ **Be super careful** — make sure you get the correct disk.

### 💾 **Step 3: Clone the card to an image file**
On **Linux**:
```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=raspi-clone.img bs=4M status=progress
```

On **macOS** (replace `rdiskX` with your SD card's identifier):
```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/rdiskX of=raspi-clone.img bs=1m
```

Replace `sdX` or `rdiskX` with your actual SD card device name. The `dd` command will make a complete binary copy of the card.

### ✅ Wait until it finishes. It might take a while.

## 🧪 **Optional: Clone directly to another SD card**

Insert both SD cards (source and destination), identify them, and run:
```bash
sudo dd if=/dev/sdX of=/dev/sdY bs=4M status=progress
```

Where `sdX` is the source (original card) and `sdY` is the target (blank card).

## 🪟 **If you're on Windows:**

### Option 1: Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/)
This tool can *write* images but doesn’t directly support cloning.

### Option 2: Use [Win32 Disk Imager](https://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)
1. Insert SD card.
2. Open Win32 Disk Imager.
3. Click **Read** to save the image from the SD card to your computer.
4. To restore it to another card, click **Write**.
